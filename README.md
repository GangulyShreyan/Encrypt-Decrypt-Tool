## ENCRYPT-DECRYPT TOOL

This is a python tool to encrypt any of your personal message and decrypt the encrpyted message at your own use.

Enter your original secret text, and press 1 to convert into some rubbish, encrypted form which none will understand!

When the user tries to encrypt his/her personal text, he is given a secret key and an encrypted text.

I've provided one encryption sample as follows:

Now, when you need you original message, you have to enter your encrypted message, and press 2 for decrypting the encrypted text to your original text.

You have to enter the key provided to you while encrypting for decryption.

I've also provided one decryption sample as follows:
